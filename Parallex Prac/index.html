            Surfing has been a sport enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people around the world.   It originated in Polynesian culture as a religious ceremony mainly practiced by the royalty.   Having been introduced from the Hawaiian Islands roughly 60 years ago, it has become a common practice in virtually every coastal beach break throughout the USA and numerous places around the globe.

These aspects become the key to the second stage. Patience is needed in order to not get frustrated with numerous possibilities, ranging from not being able to catch a wave to not having enough waves to catch.   If one begins to get frustrated then that messes up their timing and affects their ability to get properly positioned with the wave in order to drop in safely.   A lot of time is spent just waiting for the right wave to come.   This is one of the nice things about surfing for many people.   It gives them a chance to forget about their problems and responsibilities.   At the same time it can be a place to just think and clear one's mind.   Although this thought process is going on, one is to remain very attentive and constantly screening the horizon for any possible wave swells.
